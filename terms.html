                                    note that each merchant on our platform fulfils and ships their own orders
                                    independently. This

                                <p>Order Fulfilment: Once you place an order, the merchant you purchased from will
                                    process and
                                    fulfil the order. This may include packaging and preparing the shipment for pick-up

                                    These options will be displayed along with their associated costs. You can choose
                                    the option
                                    that best suits your needs and budget.</p>

                                    for issues related to your PayNback account, as refunds for purchases made with your
                                    PayNback shopping service credits are not possible.

                                    PayNback shopping service facilitates e-commerce by connecting consumers and
                                    merchants. It benefits both parties by offering significant discounts and rewards
                                    programs. These rewards and discounts are credited to your respective PayNback
                                    shopping services within the platformand can be used for future transactions between
                                    buyers and sellers. However, it's important to note that PayNback is not a bank.

                                <p>Users add credits to their PayNback shopping services by purchasing points/coupons

                                    various payment methods. These credits can be used for purchases at authorized

                                    loyalty programs, and PayNback affiliates. However, unlike cash, these credits
                                    cannot be
                                    directly withdrawn or refunded. They can only be redeemed for goods or services

                                    PayNback affiliates or used according to the specific rules of reward programs
                                    offered by
                                    PayNback or its partners. Transfers between PayNback shopping services are allowed,
                                    subject
                                    to security checks, and PayNback may charge fees for this service.</p><br>

                                    Reward credits added to a member's PayNback shopping service are for use within the
                                    specific program offered by PayNback or its partners and cannot be exchanged for

                                    While PayNback prioritizes secure and convenient credit point and reward management,
                                    refunds for purchases made with PayNback shopping service credits are typically
                                    unavailable due to the system's closed-loop nature. However, this policy details
                                    situations where you may receive compensation for issues related to your PayNback
